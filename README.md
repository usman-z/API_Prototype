### CSC 340 Fall 2023 Individual Assignment 2

This assignment is to make sure you are comfortable testing APIs using POSTMAN or similar, sending GET requests in Java, as well as reading JSON data.

Find a third party API of your choice and test it in POSTMAN to investigate the type of response it sends. Then, in Java, create a simple prototype application that connects to that API, returns JSON information, parses the most relevant pieces of that information, and prints them to the system output.
